# ViTReg-IP Architecture
![ ](https://github.com/bouthainas/ViTReg-IP/blob/main/ViTReg-IP.jpg)
## What is ViTReg-IP?
ViTReg-IP combines feature extraction models and is based on a vision transformer (ViT) that acts as a backbone for a regression (Reg) head targeting infection prediction (IP) of lungs from chest radiographs. This approach allows precise and automatic quantification of the severity of lung infection. Experimental results have shown that the proposed model has the ability and efficiency to provide peak performance in quantifying severity with high generalizability. The work is under review. The source codes and results will be made publicly available after integration of related comments. This architecture is developed in the context of a project ViTAL which aims to develop Vision-based Techniques for Analyzing lungs and to continously propose solutions through this open source initiative.
